        <h1>ABERRATION DOCUMENT: ABR-012</h1>
        <p><strong>Aberration Designation:</strong> ABR-012</p>
        <p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Class III: Hazardous</p>
        <p><strong>Containment Level:</strong> Gamma-3</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-012, known as the "Guided Ignition Projectile," is a .50 caliber bullet with seemingly ordinary physical properties. Despite its mundane appearance, ABR-012 exhibits highly anomalous behavior when fired from a compatible firearm. The projectile demonstrates extreme accuracy, trajectory control, and a capacity to generate intense thermal energy upon impact.</p>
        <p>When fired, ABR-012 can change direction mid-flight, accurately targeting a designated individual or object regardless of initial trajectory. This suggests that ABR-012 possesses a rudimentary intelligence or an advanced guidance system. Upon impact, ABR-012 releases thermal energy, with temperatures recorded to exceed ███ degrees Celsius (████ degrees Fahrenheit), incinerating the target. Additionally, ABR-012 can penetrate various materials, including reinforced concrete and multiple layers of steel plating, bypassing conventional barriers and defenses.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-012 is to be contained in a high-security ammunition locker within Research Site-64. The locker must be constructed with reinforced steel walls and monitored via surveillance cameras. Access to ABR-012 requires Level 4 clearance and explicit authorization from the Site Director. Personnel are prohibited from handling ABR-012 directly without proper authorization.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-012 poses a significant threat due to its enhanced targeting abilities and extreme thermal output. The potential for collateral damage is high, especially in urban or populated areas. Its ability to penetrate conventional barriers also raises concerns for secure facilities and armored vehicles. The psychological impact on those aware of its capabilities cannot be understated, as the fear of an unstoppable projectile can lead to heightened stress and anxiety.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-012 exhibits intelligent targeting behavior, suggesting a form of advanced guidance system or rudimentary intelligence. This behavior allows it to adjust its trajectory mid-flight to ensure impact with the intended target. The thermal release upon impact appears to be a secondary effect, likely intended to maximize damage. The projectile's ability to penetrate various materials indicates an engineered purpose, possibly for use in high-priority assassination or sabotage missions.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> ABR-012 was recovered following a high-profile assassination attempt on ██/██/████. The bullet was found at the scene and identified as the cause of the target's death. The anomalous nature of ABR-012 was quickly recognized, prompting containment by ARI personnel. Efforts to trace the origins of ABR-012 are ongoing, with current theories suggesting artificial engineering beyond known scientific capabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Incident Reports:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incident 012-01:</strong> Initial recovery of ABR-012 following a high-profile assassination. The bullet exhibited its anomalous properties during the incident, leading to the death of the target despite significant protective measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident 012-05:</strong> Testing revealed ABR-012's ability to alter its trajectory mid-flight, successfully hitting a target that was initially out of sight and behind several barriers. The projectile also demonstrated its intense thermal energy release, incinerating the target upon impact.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Research:</strong> Ongoing research aims to uncover the origins and mechanisms behind ABR-012's guidance and thermal capabilities. Investigations into potential weaknesses and methods to neutralize the projectile are a priority. Efforts to understand the guidance system, whether technological or anomalous, are also underway, with the goal of replicating or countering its effects.</p>
