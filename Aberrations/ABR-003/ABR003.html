        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-003, designated as "The Unseen Stalker," is an imperceptible entity that initiates pursuit of an individual, referred to as the target, under conditions yet to be fully understood. The entity predominantly commences tracking during nocturnal hours, though deviations are occasionally noted.</p>
        <p>ABR-003 silently shadows the target at a consistent, measured pace. Its presence is marked by an eerie, tingling sensation at the nape of the target's neck, often accompanied by heightened feelings of apprehension and unease. The pursuit ceases when the target takes refuge within an enclosed space, such as a room or a vehicle. Once the target is secluded, ABR-003 manifests through a soft, repetitive knocking on the door and mimics the voice of a familiar entity to persuade the occupants to grant entry.</p>
        <p>Bystanders with the target experience a compelling urge to open the door, rendering resistance arduous even when informed of ABR-003's nature. The only known method to resist ABR-003’s influence is the use of specialized earplugs that block the specific auditory frequency associated with it.</p>
        <p>The consequences of granting entry to ABR-003 remain uncertain, as no individuals who have done so have been found alive. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that ABR-003 possesses lethal capabilities or induces fatal conditions upon entry.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>Direct containment of ABR-003 is deemed infeasible due to its elusive nature. ARI personnel are tasked with investigating and responding to reports of ABR-003-like occurrences. A disinformation strategy is employed to discredit these accounts, attributing them to urban legends or collective delusions, thus maintaining confidentiality and preventing public panic.</p>
        <p>If an individual is confirmed to be pursued by ABR-003, immediate relocation to a secure ARI facility is mandated. On-site personnel near the target must receive comprehensive briefings on ABR-003's characteristics and be equipped with specialized earplugs to counteract its influence.</p>
        <p>Following an ABR-003 manifestation, the affected area must be secured and thoroughly cleansed by a designated response team to eliminate any residual presence.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-003 presents a substantial risk due to its ability to induce strong psychological manipulation, leading to potentially fatal outcomes. Its invisibility and the psychological influence on both the target and bystanders complicate containment and mitigation efforts. The entity's method of targeting remains unknown, broadening the potential pool of victims and increasing unpredictability.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-003 exhibits a pattern of nocturnal activity, beginning its pursuit under cover of darkness. It adheres to a consistent and measured pace, maintaining a fixed distance behind the target. The entity’s presence triggers specific psychological responses, such as the tingling sensation at the neck and a pervasive sense of dread.</p>
        <p>When the target seeks refuge in an enclosed space, ABR-003 attempts entry by mimicking a known voice. This auditory manipulation is powerful enough to compel even informed individuals to open the door, indicating a high degree of psychological influence.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> ABR-003 came to the attention of ARI following an investigation into a series of unexplained disappearances in ███████, Sweden. Survivors reported encounters with an enigmatic entity persistently trailing them and attempting unauthorized entry into their quarters. ARI agents, upon investigating these incidents, identified consistent behavioral patterns associated with ABR-003, leading to the implementation of containment protocols.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Reports:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incident 003-01:</strong> On ██/██/████, ARI personnel responding to reports of unexplained disappearances in ███████, Sweden, encountered ABR-003. The team observed the entity's behavior and recorded its attempts to mimic a familiar voice to gain entry.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident 003-02:</strong> During the night of ██/██/████, a high-priority target reported persistent sensations of being followed and hearing knocks on their door. Audio equipment confirmed the presence of ABR-003 and recorded the entity's mimicking behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident 003-03:</strong> On ██/██/████, a target under surveillance was successfully relocated to an ARI secure facility. The entity's pursuit ceased upon relocation, validating the effectiveness of ARI's containment measures.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Research:</strong> Ongoing studies aim to understand ABR-003's criteria for target selection. Current data suggests no discernible pattern, as victims vary widely in age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health. Efforts are directed toward developing more effective countermeasures and understanding the entity's origin and capabilities.</p>
