        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-008, colloquially known as the "Bone Sculptor," is a humanoid entity measuring approximately 2 meters in height. Its body is skeletal in appearance but is composed of an unknown organic material sharing similar properties to bone. ABR-008 has the anomalous ability to manipulate bone matter at will. It achieves this by making physical contact with a living organism and extracting the skeletal structure from the body without causing immediate death to the organism.</p>
        <p>Upon obtaining bone matter, ABR-008 exhibits a compulsion to create sculptures (designated ABR-008-1) of varying complexity. These sculptures are typically grotesque, resembling distorted humanoid figures or complex abstract designs. Instances of ABR-008-1 do not possess any anomalous properties and appear to be held together through unknown means, likely linked to the same ability ABR-008 uses to extract bones.</p>
        <p>Victims of ABR-008, while initially remaining alive after the extraction of their bones, typically die within hours due to internal collapse and organ failure. ABR-008 displays no signs of understanding or empathy towards its victims and seems solely focused on the creation of ABR-008-1.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ABR-008 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell must be constructed entirely of high-tensile steel, and no materials containing calcium are to be introduced into the cell without express permission from at least two Level 4 personnel.</li>
            <li>The cell should be monitored at all times by at least two personnel trained in cognitohazard resistance.</li>
            <li>In the event of a containment breach, ABR-008 is to be sedated using remotely activated gas-based anesthetic systems and re-contained by MTF-██-██ ("███████████") personnel.</li>
            <li>If ABR-008 creates an instance of ABR-008-1, containment personnel should document the sculpture and dispose of it through incineration after receiving clearance from a Level 4 researcher.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-008 poses a moderate danger to personnel and local populations due to its ability to extract bone matter from living organisms, causing eventual death. Its focus on creating sculptures makes it predictable in behavior, but its lack of empathy and understanding towards its victims increases its hazard level. The need for constant monitoring and potential for containment breaches necessitates robust containment measures.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-008's primary behavior involves the extraction of bone matter and the creation of sculptures. It does not show signs of intelligence or intentionality beyond this compulsion. Research indicates that ABR-008 experiences distress if it cannot create an instance of ABR-008-1 for an extended period. Understanding this behavior could lead to improved containment strategies.</p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Addendum 008-1:</strong> ABR-008 was discovered in █████, Russia, after local authorities were alerted to a series of unusual deaths in the area. The ARI was alerted, and ABR-008 was located and contained without incident. A cover story of a serial killer was disseminated to explain the deaths, and the case was officially closed.</li>
            <li><strong>Addendum 008-2:</strong> Research into the behavior of ABR-008 when it is unable to create an ABR-008-1 instance is ongoing. Preliminary findings suggest that the entity experiences increasing levels of distress, which may be exploited for containment purposes.</li>
        </ul>
