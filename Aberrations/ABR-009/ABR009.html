        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-009, colloquially known as "Bobble the Clown," is an entity taking the form of a 30 cm tall doll resembling a stereotypical circus clown. The doll appears to be made from a common polyvinyl chloride (PVC) type plastic. During daylight hours, ABR-009 is inert, displaying no anomalous properties. However, between the hours of 22:00 and 04:00, ABR-009 activates and becomes sentient, exhibiting an array of behaviors focused on inducing fear and panic in humans.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-009 is to be secured within a reinforced containment locker at Site-64. The locker must be equipped with advanced locking mechanisms and be under constant surveillance by motion sensors and cameras. Two armed guards are required to monitor the locker around the clock. Surveillance footage is to be reviewed daily for any irregularities.</p>
        <p>Upon activation of ABR-009, containment breach protocols must be immediately enacted, triggering Site-64's Lockdown Procedure Echo-7. Post-activation, all personnel in the vicinity must undergo mandatory psychological screening before resuming duties. Monthly psychological evaluations are mandatory for all staff assigned to ABR-009. Personnel exhibiting high stress, anxiety, or trauma are to be reassigned.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-009 poses a severe psychological threat to personnel. Prolonged exposure results in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Severe anxiety and stress</li>
            <li>Recurring night terrors</li>
            <li>Development of debilitating phobias, particularly involving clowns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, ABR-009's ability to influence electronic devices suggests a broader range of potential threats, including cyber manipulation and mass psychological influence.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>When active, ABR-009 demonstrates unpredictable behavior, ranging from subtle manipulation of its surroundings to outright physical aggression. It has been observed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move autonomously</li>
            <li>Emit a range of sound effects and voices, despite no visible sound-producing mechanism</li>
            <li>Manipulate nearby objects, often using them to frighten or harm individuals</li>
            <li>Exhibit strength far beyond what its small, plastic form should allow</li>
            <li>Enter the dreams of individuals within a 30-meter radius, creating vivid and terrifying scenarios involving clowns or circus themes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ABR-009's voice, which seems to originate from an indeterminate source within the doll, is that of an adult male, frequently taunting and threatening those nearby. The entity's malevolent influence extends to electronic devices, enabling it to manipulate televisions, radios, and computers, further complicating containment efforts.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Background:</strong> ABR-009 was recovered from ████████, a small town in ████████, after a series of unexplained deaths and psychological breakdowns. The doll was found in the attic of an abandoned house, surrounded by strange symbols and markings. Initial containment was achieved by Dr. █████, who noted the entity's nocturnal activity and psychological impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Reports:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incident 009-12:</strong> First recorded activation. ABR-009 moved independently, causing significant distress to personnel. Lockdown procedures were successfully enacted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident 009-17:</strong> ABR-009 manipulated Site-64's broadcast system, resulting in widespread panic. Incident led to the implementation of enhanced electronic containment measures.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Current research focuses on understanding the source of ABR-009's power, its connection to fear, and potential methods to neutralize its influence. Studies on affected personnel aim to develop better psychological support and resistance protocols.</li>
        </ul>
