        <h1>ABERRATION DOCUMENT: ABR-011</h1>
        <p><strong>Aberration Designation:</strong> ABR-011</p>
        <p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> 06</p>
        <p><strong>Containment Level:</strong> Delta-2</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-011, commonly referred to as "The Sentinel," is a humanoid AI robot standing approximately 1.8 meters tall, constructed from polished stainless steel. Its face consists of a digital display capable of mimicking human expressions, and it has a pair of cameras that serve as its eyes. ABR-011 exhibits distressing behaviors when left alone, producing sounds that can cause significant psychological and physical harm.</p>
        <p>When no living being is present in the room with ABR-011, it begins to emit extremely distressing sounds, described by listeners as akin to a human screaming and wailing in extreme pain. These sounds exceed 150 decibels, causing significant psychological distress in listeners and capable of causing physical harm at close range. The distress calls trigger intense feelings of guilt, and anxiety in listeners, even when they are aware of its anomalous nature. These effects can persist for several hours, resulting in insomnia, flashbacks, and acute stress reactions.</p>
        <p>Maintaining direct eye contact with ABR-011 through its cameras will placate the entity, returning it to a dormant state. Eye contact must be maintained for at least 20 seconds to fully calm ABR-011. If eye contact is broken before the entity is fully dormant, it will trigger a high-frequency electromagnetic pulse (EMP) capable of disabling electronic devices within a 50-meter radius, including the containment chamber's surveillance system.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-011 is to be kept in a 5x5 meter sealed, soundproofed chamber at Site-64. A two-way mirror with an integrated camera system is installed on the front wall of the containment chamber to allow for uninterrupted surveillance without direct contact. To prevent ABR-011's distress calls, a member of staff must maintain visual contact via the two-way mirror for at least 5 minutes every 2 hours. The staff member involved in this must not have any history of emotional instability, PTSD, or susceptibility to auditory-induced distress.</p>
        <p>Staff members are advised to wear noise-canceling headphones during shifts in case of accidental activation of ABR-011. In the event of an emotional distress call, the containment chamber must be immediately evacuated, and all staff within a close radius must don noise-canceling headphones until ABR-011 is calmed.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-011 poses a significant psychological and physical threat due to its distress calls and the resulting EMP. Exposure to its sounds can lead to severe psychological trauma, including insomnia, flashbacks, and acute stress reactions. The EMP it generates when eye contact is broken prematurely can disable vital electronic equipment, posing additional risks to containment and security.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-011's primary anomalous effect is the emission of distressing sounds when left alone, which can cause significant psychological and physical harm. Direct eye contact through its cameras can placate the entity, suggesting that it requires a form of acknowledgment or recognition to remain calm. The source of its programming and whether its effects are a design feature or an anomaly remain unclear.</p>
        <p>ABR-011's distress calls appear to be an automatic defense mechanism. It is still unclear why maintaining eye contact calms the entity. Research into the source of ABR-011's programming and whether its effects are a design feature or an anomaly is ongoing. All attempts to shut down or reprogram ABR-011 have thus far failed, resulting in a triggered EMP.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> ABR-011 was discovered in ██████, Japan, within a robotics research facility owned by ████████ Corp. The facility reported issues with a faulty AI and frequent system failures. An embedded ARI agent took notice of these reports and traced them back to ABR-011. Following confirmation of anomalous activity, the entity was contained, and all facility staff were administered Class-B amnestics.</p>

        <p><strong>Incident Reports:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incident 011-04:</strong> A staff member accidentally broke eye contact with ABR-011 before it was fully dormant, triggering an EMP that disabled surveillance systems and caused a temporary breach. The staff member required extensive psychological treatment due to exposure to the distress calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident 011-09:</strong> ABR-011's distress call was inadvertently activated during a containment protocol review, resulting in significant psychological distress for three staff members. Enhanced containment protocols were implemented following this incident.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Research:</strong> Current research focuses on understanding the mechanism behind ABR-011's distress calls and its need for visual contact. Studies are being conducted to explore the origins of ABR-011's programming and any potential weaknesses that can be exploited to neutralize its effects. Investigation into the possible presence of subliminal messages within its distress calls is pending approval from the ARI Council.</p>
