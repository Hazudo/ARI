        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-015, known as "The Reflective Abyss," is an ornate, full-length mirror standing approximately 2 meters tall and 1 meter wide. The frame is crafted from a dark, unknown metal intricately designed with motifs of twisted faces and agonized figures. The mirror's surface appears perfectly reflective under all lighting conditions.</p>
        <p>The anomalous properties of ABR-015 manifest when any individual gazes into its surface. Instead of reflecting a normal image, ABR-015 reveals the viewer's deepest fears and insecurities in vivid, lifelike detail. These reflections are not mere illusions but are experienced as intensely real, causing immediate psychological distress.</p>
        <p>Prolonged exposure to ABR-015 results in severe mental trauma, leading to acute paranoia, hallucinations, and in extreme cases, complete mental breakdown and insanity. The effects of the mirror are so profound that even brief glances can induce lingering anxiety and fear.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-015 is to be contained within a 5x5x5 meter reinforced containment chamber at ARI Site-77. The chamber walls must be lined with non-reflective, matte black material to prevent accidental exposure. The entrance to the chamber requires Level 4 clearance, and entry must be authorized by the Site Director.</p>
        <p>Any personnel interacting with ABR-015 must wear opaque, reflective visors to prevent direct eye contact with the mirror's surface. Visual monitoring of ABR-015 is strictly prohibited; all observations must be conducted through remote sensing equipment and indirect methods.</p>
        <p>In the event of a containment breach, immediate evacuation of the sector is mandatory. Mobile task forces equipped with full visual obscuration gear will be deployed to re-contain ABR-015. Psychological support teams must be on standby to assist affected personnel.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-015 poses a significant psychological hazard due to its ability to reveal and amplify personal fears and insecurities. The mirror's influence can lead to rapid mental deterioration and poses a substantial threat to the mental health of all personnel. Strict containment and handling protocols are essential to prevent widespread psychological harm.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-015 appears to be reactive to any form of observation, actively engaging the viewer's subconscious fears. The exact mechanism by which ABR-015 identifies and reflects these fears is unknown, suggesting a potentially sentient or semi-sentient nature. The reflections presented by ABR-015 are dynamic and adapt to the viewer's changing psychological state.</p>
        <p>Analysis indicates that the mirror's effects are cumulative, with repeated exposure leading to increasingly severe psychological symptoms. Efforts to understand the origin and nature of ABR-015's powers are ongoing, with research focused on identifying potential countermeasures or mitigating strategies.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>ABR-015 was discovered in the basement of an abandoned mansion in ██████, England, following reports of unexplained disappearances and local legends of a "cursed mirror." ARI agents retrieved ABR-015 after confirming its anomalous properties. The mansion was subsequently demolished to prevent further incidents, and local witnesses were treated with Class-B amnestics.</p>

        <h3>Incident Reports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incident 015-A:</strong> During initial containment, a researcher inadvertently viewed ABR-015's surface and experienced a severe psychological breakdown, resulting in self-harm and incoherent speech. The researcher required immediate medical and psychological intervention and has since been placed on indefinite leave.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident 015-B:</strong> A containment breach occurred when ABR-015's chamber was accidentally exposed to a reflective surface, leading to the mirror's anomalous effects propagating beyond the containment unit. The sector was evacuated, and containment was re-established using non-reflective barriers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experiment 015-01:</strong> Initial experiments to understand the range of ABR-015's effects revealed that the mirror's influence is confined to direct line-of-sight exposure. Indirect viewing through reflections or video feeds does not trigger the anomalous properties, though caution is still advised.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment 015-02:</strong> Attempts to analyze the psychological impact of ABR-015 suggest that the mirror interacts with the viewer's subconscious mind, selectively amplifying latent fears and insecurities. The exact neural mechanisms involved remain a subject of ongoing study.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proposal for Reclassification</h3>
        <p>Given the profound psychological risks and the potential for widespread mental health crises, there is a proposal to reclassify ABR-015 as Class V: Apocalyptic. This proposal is currently under review by the Executive Council, pending further research and risk assessment.</p>
