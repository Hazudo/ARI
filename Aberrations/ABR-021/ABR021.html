        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-021, codenamed "Infinite Vase," is a ceramic vase measuring approximately 30 cm in height and 15 cm in diameter. Its exterior is decorated with intricate, abstract patterns that appear to shift and change when viewed from different angles, though no adverse cognitive effects have been reported.</p>
        <p>ABR-021 exhibits the anomalous property of possessing an apparently infinite internal capacity. Regardless of the volume or type of material introduced into ABR-021, it will never overflow. Liquids, solids, and even gases can be stored within ABR-021, which retains the physical state and properties of the contents indefinitely.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-021 is to be stored in a secure containment locker at ARI Site-19. Access is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher. ABR-021 must remain sealed with its custom-fitted lid when not in use to prevent unintentional filling. All experiments involving ABR-021 are to be conducted in a designated containment chamber equipped with advanced drainage systems and liquid containment protocols.</p>
        <p>Personnel handling ABR-021 are required to undergo training in liquid anomaly management. Any incidents of spillage or overflow must be reported immediately to Site Command.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-021 poses a significant risk due to its ability to generate severe weather conditions based on its emotional state. Distress can lead to dangerous phenomena such as intense thunderstorms and electrical discharges. The entity's unpredictability necessitates rigorous containment protocols to protect ARI personnel and infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>The entity exhibits a range of behaviors linked to its emotional state, with calm periods marked by benign weather patterns and distress leading to severe weather events. Initial interactions have demonstrated the entity's ability to understand and respond to visual cues, although sudden changes in mood can result in hazardous conditions.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> The Nephological Entity was discovered following unusual meteorological events in [REDACTED]. Initial containment involved managing an intense thunderstorm, believed to be a manifestation of the entity's distress. Over time, ARI's containment measures have significantly reduced its distress levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Report #001:</strong> During an initial communication attempt, Doctor ████ and Researcher ████ were injured by an electrical discharge caused by the entity's distress. Both sustained burns and required medical treatment. This incident led to the integration of a Faraday cage within the containment cell and revised communication strategies to prevent future distress.</p>
        <p><strong>Containment Protocol Revision:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faraday Cage: Added to prevent electrical discharges.</li>
            <li>Emotional Intelligence Training: Required for all personnel interacting with the entity to reduce potential distress triggers.</li>
            <li>Emergency Evacuation Directive: Established for swift evacuation in case of increased distress signals.</li>
        </ul>
