        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-022, codenamed "Rebreather," appears to be an ordinary rebreather device used for underwater breathing. It consists of a mouthpiece connected to a cylindrical filtration unit. The exterior is made of stainless steel, and it shows no manufacturer's markings or identifiable origin.</p>
        <p>ABR-022 functions anomalously by continuously providing breathable air indefinitely, without the need for refills or external power sources. Testing has revealed that the filtration system within ABR-022 operates without any conventional filters or components typically found in rebreathers. Despite extensive analysis, the internal mechanisms responsible for this anomaly remain undetermined.</p>
        <p>Individuals using ABR-022 report a sense of calmness and mental clarity while breathing through it, which suggests a possible psychological effect. Further psychological evaluation of long-term exposure to ABR-022 is ongoing.</p>
        <p>Attempts to dismantle or understand the inner workings of ABR-022 have been unsuccessful, as any attempts to open or modify it have resulted in the object reverting to its original state without any visible damage.</p>
        <p>ABR-022 was recovered from an abandoned underwater research facility off the coast of [REDACTED], following reports of unexplained disappearances among the research team stationed there. Investigation into the connection between ABR-022 and these disappearances is ongoing.</p>

        <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
        <p>ABR-022 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-XX. Access is restricted to Level 2 personnel or higher. Testing involving ABR-022 requires approval from at least one Level 3 researcher.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>The primary risk associated with ABR-022 is its potential psychological dependency. While initially providing calmness and mental clarity, prolonged use could lead to a strong attachment and reluctance to remove the device, as evidenced by Incident Report #022-01.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>Initial tests indicate that ABR-022 induces a state of calmness and enhances cognitive functions. However, extended use appears to increase attachment and dependency on the device. Further studies are required to determine the long-term psychological effects and potential dependencies that may arise from prolonged exposure.</p>

        <h2>Appendices</h2>
        <p class="incident-report"><strong>Incident Report #022-01:</strong></p>
        <p class="closer-text">During a 24-hour experiment with ABR-022, D-5432 exhibited initial calmness and enhanced cognitive function. After prolonged use, D-5432 developed a strong attachment to ABR-022, displaying reluctance to remove it and escalating aggression upon termination of the experiment. Neurochemical analysis suggested ABR-022 may induce psychological dependency. Research into ABR-022's effects on human behavior and cognition is ongoing.</p>
