        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-023, colloquially referred to as the "Energivore Battery," is an anomalous energy storage device of unknown origin. The battery is cylindrical, approximately 30 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter, with a matte black surface. The device appears to have no seams or openings and is composed of a material that has not been identified by current scientific methods.</p>
        <p>The primary anomalous property of ABR-023 is its ability to autonomously absorb electrical energy from its environment. When in proximity to an electrical source, the battery charges rapidly, drawing energy at an exponential rate. Additionally, it has demonstrated the capability to drain energy from nearby electronic devices within a radius of approximately 5 meters, often causing them to fail or become inoperative.</p>
        <p>ABR-023 does not exhibit any traditional means of energy release, such as terminals or connectors. Current attempts to access the stored energy using conventional methods have failed, and the exact mechanism of energy extraction remains unknown. Experimental attempts to interface with ABR-023 have resulted in catastrophic failures, including severe electrical burns and explosions, indicating extreme caution is required.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-023 is to be housed in a specially designed electromagnetic shielding chamber within the Gamma Containment Wing. The chamber must be constructed of reinforced materials resistant to high temperatures and electrical surges.</p>
        <p>An energy suppression field must be maintained at all times to neutralize any ambient energy absorption. This field is calibrated to create a zero-energy environment around ABR-023, preventing it from drawing power from nearby sources.</p>
        <p>Continuous monitoring via non-electronic surveillance systems is required. Any fluctuations in the containment field or energy levels should trigger an immediate containment breach protocol.</p>
        <p>Only personnel with Gamma-2 clearance and above are authorized to access the containment chamber. Any interaction with ABR-023 requires approval from the Division Head and must be conducted using remote manipulation systems to avoid direct contact.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-023 poses a significant risk due to its unpredictable energy absorption and storage capabilities. The potential for accidental energy release or containment failure could result in severe damage to ARI infrastructure and personnel. The device's ability to drain power from electronic systems also presents a threat to critical operations.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-023 does not exhibit behavior in the traditional sense but has been observed to display varying rates of energy absorption depending on environmental conditions. It appears to "prefer" high-density energy sources and will prioritize draining such sources when available. This quasi-selective behavior indicates a level of autonomous functionality that is not fully understood.</p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>ABR-023 was recovered from a ██████████████ facility during a raid on suspected aberration storage sites. The origin and original purpose of the battery remain unknown. Initial analysis suggests it may have been part of a larger energy management system, possibly extraterrestrial in nature.</p>
        <p>Several incidents have been documented where ABR-023 caused widespread electronic failures in the vicinity, leading to containment breaches of other Aberrations and significant structural damage. Detailed incident reports are filed under IDs ABR-023-IR-001 through ABR-023-IR-007.</p>
        <p>Ongoing research focuses on identifying the material composition of ABR-023 and its energy storage mechanisms. Experimentation with containment field variations and energy suppression techniques is ongoing, with periodic updates submitted to the Gamma Division Research Committee.</p>
