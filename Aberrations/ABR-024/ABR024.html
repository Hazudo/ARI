        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-024, formerly known as OR-273, is an offshore oil rig located in the Gulf of Mexico. This rig exhibits anomalous behavior, notably shifting its location by an average of 20 nautical miles whenever all individuals on board simultaneously fall asleep. These shifts occur instantaneously and without any detectable intermediate states.</p>
        <p>The oil rig was first brought to the attention of ARI on ██/██/20██ following a series of reports from maritime tracking stations. Initially reported missing, ABR-024 reappeared several miles from its original position with the crew discovered in a state of unexplained unconsciousness, having relocated without any awareness.</p>
        <p>On ██/██/20██, ABR-024 exhibited a significant anomalous event where the drilling apparatus began extracting a substance identified as human blood, designated ABR-024-A, instead of crude oil. ABR-024-A comprises various human blood types with DNA indicating multiple human donors. The volume extracted far exceeds any natural source, suggesting an extradimensional or otherwise anomalous reservoir.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>ABR-024 is monitored remotely via satellite and a dedicated observation vessel stationed 10 nautical miles away. Direct human interaction is prohibited. Any ships or aircraft approaching within 5 nautical miles are to be redirected by MTF Theta-4 ("Oil Slickers") under the guise of routine maritime patrols.</p>
        <p>No personnel are to be stationed on ABR-024. Maintenance and investigations must be conducted using remote-controlled drones. Assigned personnel must undergo psychological evaluations and training to prevent unconsciousness during operations.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-024 poses a severe threat due to its unpredictable relocations and the extraction of ABR-024-A. The presence of human blood suggests a potential extradimensional reservoir, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. The shifts in location disrupt maritime traffic and pose a risk of collisions or other accidents.</p>
        <p>The discovery of humanoid figures in the dense fog surrounding ABR-024 during anomalous events indicates a potential intelligent or reactive component. This necessitates extreme caution and further study to understand the nature and intentions of these entities.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-024's anomalous activity increases when all individuals on board fall asleep. The extraction of ABR-024-A occurs during these shifts, accompanied by environmental changes such as the appearance of dense fog and humanoid figures. These entities, captured on drone footage, remain indistinct and non-aggressive but suggest a possible sentient interaction with ABR-024.</p>
        <p>The rig's behavior indicates a potential link between human consciousness and its anomalous properties, necessitating remote operations and continuous monitoring.</p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Initial anomalous activities were reported in November 20██ following a severe storm causing extensive damage to the rig. Crew members reported seeing figures and hearing disturbing sounds, leading to the identification of the rig as an aberration.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Reports:</strong> Numerous incidents have been documented, including the disappearance of crew members, electrical fires, and acute psychological distress among the crew. Detailed reports are available for review by authorized personnel.</p>
        <p><strong>Experiments and Research:</strong> Ongoing research aims to identify the source of ABR-024-A and the mechanism behind the rig's shifts. Experimental protocols involve advanced sensors and recording devices to analyze phenomena in real-time.</p>
