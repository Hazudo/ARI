        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-026, informally referred to as "Nox," is a black and white cat-like entity residing within the Aberration Research Institute (ARI) headquarters. Nox is characterized by its non-vocal nature, apart from occasional purring. Its presence has been consistently linked to moments of significant emotional distress among personnel, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to provide comfort to those in need. Notably, there is no documented evidence of its existenceâ€”only detailed witness accounts from personnel who have encountered the entity.</p>
        <p>The origin of Nox is unknown; its first recorded sighting was by a test subject who had recently survived a high-stress incident. Nox appeared to the subject while they were alone and in a state of distress. Since then, sporadic reports have surfaced of Nox wandering the facility late at night, though these remain unverified.</p>
 
        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>Due to the benign nature of ABR-026, no formal containment measures are necessary. Nox appears to have a limited area of influence, voluntarily residing within ARI headquarters and manifesting only under specific circumstances. Observations suggest that Nox is self-containing, as it avoids detection and interacts selectively. Personnel are advised to document encounters and provide detailed descriptions for records.</p>
      
        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>Nox poses no known threat to ARI personnel or infrastructure. Its actions are perceived as entirely benevolent, offering psychological support. While its unpredictability in manifestation could be considered mildly concerning, there is no indication of harmful intent. Thus, the potential risks associated with Nox are minimal and primarily pertain to the potential psychological impact on personnel who encounter it unexpectedly.</p>
      
        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>Nox exhibits behavior typical of a domestic cat, notably seeking out those in emotional distress and offering comfort through presence and purring. It is silent, non-aggressive, and shows an ability to appear and disappear from sight without a trace. Its pattern of interaction remains consistent: Nox does not approach groups, nor does it interact with personnel unless they are alone and visibly distressed. This behavior indicates a potential empathic ability, although this is unconfirmed.</p>
      
        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>Despite rumors of Nox's existence circulating among personnel, no substantial proof has been collected. It remains a subject of speculation among those who have not experienced it firsthand. Nonetheless, accounts from individuals who have encountered Nox suggest that its presence has a calming effect, with many reporting feelings of reassurance and comfort.</p>
        <p>While the exact nature and origin of Nox are unknown, ARI researchers remain vigilant for any new information. Given the beneficial influence Nox has had on personnel morale, it is considered a welcomed, if enigmatic, presence within the facility.</p>
