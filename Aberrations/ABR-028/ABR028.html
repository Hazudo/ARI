        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ABR-028, referred to as “The Hollow Drown,” is a 40m x 40m body of still water situated in ██████████, enveloped by dense forest terrain. The anomaly appears natural in formation, bearing resemblance to a small lake or deep sinkhole. However, beneath the surface lies a submerged entrance to an unmapped cave system. The opening, approximately 3 meters wide, is positioned at the center of the lakebed and extends into a seemingly infinite subaquatic tunnel network. All attempts to fully map this system have failed.</p>
        <p>When ABR-028 is viewed directly—either in person or via live optical feed—affected individuals begin to experience escalating psychological compulsion. This begins as a mild curiosity or attraction to the water but quickly escalates to a primal, often irrational, need to enter and submerge themselves. The closer an individual gets to the shoreline, the more intense this compulsion becomes, typically culminating in full submersion and eventual disappearance.</p>
        <p>Those unaware of ABR-028’s properties invariably succumb to this influence, often exhibiting signs of dissociation and delusion. Witnesses describe hearing voices or perceiving that "air" or "light" exists deeper within the abyss, resulting in rapid and fatal descent into the cave system. Drone footage (see Incident-028-01) confirms that victims increase their descent speed once panic and hypoxia onset, as though believing salvation lies further below.</p>
        <p>Any technological device that descends into the cave beyond 30 seconds of submersion loses all signal transmission. In all documented cases, drones either suffer total destruction or vanish without recovery. Sonar imaging suggests depth exceeds 300 meters, though confirmation is impossible.</p>

        <h2>Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>A 7-foot electrified steel fence has been constructed in a wide perimeter 140 meters from the water’s edge. Surveillance towers equipped with thermal and motion sensors have been installed at intervals of 30 meters around the fence line. Unauthorized approach is to be met with non-lethal deterrents, and all personnel stationed in the area are to undergo psychological resilience testing every 96 hours.</p>
        <p>Personnel are forbidden from maintaining visual contact with the water for more than 15 seconds. Optics are only to be accessed through filtered lenses equipped with SCRAMBLE-VI overlays, which have proven effective in limiting the initial compulsion phase.</p>
        <p>Diving is categorically prohibited. Any object or person submerged for more than 30 seconds is to be declared unrecoverable.</p>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>ABR-028 poses a high cognitive hazard with memetic and spatially manipulative traits. The entity (or entities) within the submerged cave network have not been directly observed, but behavioral indicators suggest the existence of an active intelligence or predatory mechanism designed to lure and trap sentient organisms.</p>
        <p>The risk extends beyond individuals physically present; remote viewers of live video can experience weakened but present compulsive symptoms. This expands ABR-028’s classification from a strictly local hazard to a potential vector for indirect psychological compromise.</p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p>ABR-028 exhibits passive yet persistent influence. It does not require physical movement or active change to exert its effect. The compulsion acts uniformly across subjects regardless of background, mental conditioning, or resistance training, though cognitively resilient individuals experience delayed onset.</p>
        <p>There is speculation among Division ██ researchers that the aberration mimics instinctual attraction responses—such as the human need for water, safety, or sanctuary—and warps them into lethal impulses. Audio captured just before drone blackouts include distorted human speech, including pleas for help or whispered affirmations such as "keep going" and "you're almost there."</p>
        <p>Witnesses in recovery frequently experience lingering symptoms, including hydrophobia, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation centered on "returning to the deep." Approximately 74% of these subjects relapse within 30 days.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
        ABR-028 was discovered on 07/10/20██ following the disappearance of amateur cave divers Michael Thorne and Jenna Layne. The pair had reportedly sought out a rumored submerged cave system for exploration, leaving their vehicle parked at the forest’s edge. Their equipment was never recovered.</p>
        <p>Search parties initially dismissed the body of water as non-hazardous. However, multiple responding personnel began walking directly toward the waterline without instruction. One responder entered the water and drowned before retrieval could occur. It was at this point that ARI was notified and assumed control.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Report Excerpt – Incident ID: 028-01</strong><br>
        Drone 028-A entered the lake at 06:14 local time. The initial descent revealed the cave mouth and part of the smooth, nearly symmetrical tunnel walls, marked by spiral grooves of unknown origin. At 00:00:32 of continuous footage, the camera feed showed what appeared to be a humanoid silhouette reaching toward the drone—followed immediately by total signal loss. No wreckage has been recovered.</p>
